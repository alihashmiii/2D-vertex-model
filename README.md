# 2D-vertex-model

`Author: Ali Hashmi`

Developed in Mathematica 12.1 (some functionality might be unique to 12.1, but the notebook can be easily tweaked to work with prior versions). 

`Added to the code: T1 (neighbour switching), T2 (cell removal) transitions & cell divisions`


`a probable addition for future may include T3 transition (needed in rare simulation cases where self-intersection is an issue)`
