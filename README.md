# 2D-vertex-model

`Author: Ali Hashmi`

Developed in Mathematica 12.1 (some functionality might be unique to 12.1, but the notebook can be easily tweaked to work with prior versions). 

Added to the code: T1 (neighbour switching) T2 (cell removal) transitions & cell divisions

To add in future: T3 transition
